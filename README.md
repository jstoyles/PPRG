# PPRG
This uses a PHP framework I created to fetch and show the most popular PHP repos on Github

## Installation

```bash
Download the repo and upload it to a server running PHP
Set the site root to point to the public folder
```

## Requirements
```bash
- Web Server - Tested on Apache with mod_rewrite enabled
    If a different server is used, some sort of URL rewrite rules will need to be in place to manage dynamic routing
- PHP - 7+ (tested on 7.4.1)
- MySQL 5.7+
```
